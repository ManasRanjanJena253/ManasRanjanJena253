## Summary
I build reproducible, end-to-end machine learning systems that bridge research and production. My work spans generative models, reinforcement learning agents, full-stack ML tooling, and applied NLP/LLM work. I emphasize clean engineering, measurable impact, and deployable systems rather than experiments that stop at a notebook.

- **Current:** B.Tech (Mathematics & Computing) — Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh (Class of 2028)  
- **Started focused ML/AI work:** September 2024  
- **Primary focus areas:** LLM / LCM engineering, generative AI systems, quant/algorithmic trading, and robust model deployment

---

## Selected highlights & projects
Short, high-impact projects that demonstrate full-stack ML and systems thinking.

- **SwiftPredict** — AutoML Python library (`pip install swiftpredict_dev`) that automates preprocessing → model selection → training pipelines. (Repo: `SwiftPredict`)  
- **Multi-Agent Code Refiner (MCP protocol)** — Full-stack system with LangChain-based agents (CodeWriter, SyntaxFixer, Optimizer, DocAgent, Reviewer), FastAPI orchestration, MongoDB session/state tracking, and a React + Tailwind frontend. Demonstrates agent coordination, reproducible workflows, and scoring.  
- **DCGAN (PyTorch)** — Implemented and logged experiments via TensorBoard; emphasis on stable training and reproducible checkpoints.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** — DQN agent trained to play *Flappy Bird* using `gymnasium`; focused on reward shaping and stable replay buffers.  
- **Mental_Health_Helper_AI** — Deployed conversational demo and frontend (live demo available in my GitHub Pages).  
- **Financial Insight Web App** — End-to-end data ingestion, modeling, and dashboarding for finance insights.

## Core skills & tools
I value breadth with depth — I pick tools that let me ship end-to-end solutions.

**Languages**
- Python (primary)

**Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- PyTorch, torchvision, Hugging Face Transformers, CNNs (ResNet), GANs

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Gymnasium environments, DQN implementations, reward engineering

**Data & MLOps**
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorBoard  
- MLflow, Docker, CI/CD fundamentals, experiment tracking

**Deployment & Backend**
- FastAPI, Streamlit, Flask (prototypes)  
- MongoDB (session/state persistence), containerized deployments

**Tooling & Integrations**
- OpenCV (vision pipelines), LangChain (agent orchestration), Git/GitHub workflows

---

## How I work (opinionated)
- **Reproducibility first** — deterministic seeds, versioned datasets, and experiment tracking.  
- **End-to-end mindset** — a model isn’t complete until it can be evaluated in the context of an application or deployment.  
- **Small, testable increments** — iterate in minimal vertical slices: data → model → API → UI.  
- **Explainability & meaningful metrics** — optimize for robust improvements tied to measurable goals.

---

## Open for
- Collaborative projects in LLM engineering, generative models, reinforcement learning, and quant trading.  
- Remote internships (AI/ML-focused).  
- Speaking or writing opportunities about agent architectures, reproducible ML, or end-to-end deployment.

## Quick start — run my demo repos
Each project contains a `README.md` with step-by-step instructions. Typical steps I use across repos:

1. `git clone <repo-url>`  
2. Create a virtual environment and install `requirements.txt`  
3. Follow the project-specific `README` for dataset downloads or API keys (if required)  
4. Use available `scripts/` or `Makefile` to reproduce training and launch the demo UI

Tip: for reproducibility in judged demos, I recommend adding one-command Dockerized scripts for each project.
